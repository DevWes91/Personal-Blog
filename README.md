## This is a personal blog page for a user to write down their thoughts, feelings, notes or whatever they please. The page then saves the sumbissions and redirects to a listed page with a history of all posts made for a user to review. 

## Getting Started

To clone this repository and view it locally, navigate to the green 'code' button in the top right of the repository and use the drop down button to copy the repository's url. Then using your local command shell (example: terminal or gitbash), create the directory you'd like to add the repository to. Navigate into the directory using your command line. Execute the 'git clone' command followed by the url of the repository you copied. The repoistory should now be available inside the local directory you just created to view and edit or review the source code in your IDE.

## Usage 

To use the page, navigate to the URL. Once on the page enter a Username, Title, and type some content: your thoughts, feelings, or anything you may want to take note of! From there the page will log your published post into a list for you to go back to and look at later.
